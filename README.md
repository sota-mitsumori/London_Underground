# London Underground Timetable for the Victoria Line
This is a simple project that uses the London Underground API to get the timetable for a given station for the Victoria Line. 

Users can select the station they want to get the timetable for and the program will return the platform, destination, and time of the next train.

The train status is updated every minute.
